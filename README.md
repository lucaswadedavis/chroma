# Chroma

Chroma is a simple demonstration of how very little vanilla Javascript (really 2 important lines of HTML, and 5 of Javascript - though it could have been done in 3 by sacrificing a bit of clarity) can be used to accomplish something that often developers resort to large cumbersome frameworks to achieve.

As an example of the alternative, the same application is here written using Angular - which replaces those 5 lines of vanilla Javascript with 28,000 lines of Angular.

There is an absolutely valid argument to using a framework when the situation calls for it - a good engineer has many tools, and applies each at right time.

"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."
