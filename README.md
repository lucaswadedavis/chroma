# Chroma

Chroma is a simple demonstration of how very little vanilla Javascript (really 2 important lines of HTML, and 5 of Javascript - though it could have been done in 3 by sacrificing a bit of clarity) can be used to accomplish something that often developers resort to large cumbersome frameworks to achieve.

"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

-Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry
